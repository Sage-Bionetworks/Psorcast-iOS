        <p>Before you volunteer, it is important to know how much time is involved.</p>

        <p>Signing up to volunteer for this study takes about 10 minutes. After that, the study takes about 5-10 minutes each week.</p>

        <p>You decide when and how much to participate. You can stop and start your participation at any time.</p>

        <p>Transmitting data collected in this study may count against your mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use Wi-Fi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan.  We estimate that using the app will use 0.003GB data per week)</p>
