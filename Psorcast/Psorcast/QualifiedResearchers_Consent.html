        <p>We share coded study data with qualified researchers worldwide. Who are qualified researchers?</p>

        <p>Qualified researchers must register on Synapse, our data-sharing and analysis platform. To register, researchers must tell us their name, email address, organization, and location. This information is public. You can see the Synapse terms and policy.</p>

        <p>Also, qualified researchers must write a short statement about their research. We post these statements publically. You will be able to review them on Synapse when research is done with the data.</p>

        <p>Finally, researchers must sign an oath. They agree to use the data ethically and to do no harm. They promise to not identify you or contact you without your permission.</p>

        <p>Anyone in the US or abroad can apply to become a qualified researcher. For example, doctors working at hospitals or scientists at universities. Researchers who work for commercial companies, like drug manufacturers, can apply. Private citizens can also apply.</p>
        
        <p>If we change these rules for any reasons we will let you know.</p>
