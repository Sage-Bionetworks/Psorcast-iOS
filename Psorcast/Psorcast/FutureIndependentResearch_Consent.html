        <p>The same coded study data that you donate for the Psorcast Study could be used for other research. We give you the option to share your coded study data with other researchers worldwide for other research.</p>

        <p>You get to decide if you want to share. Here are important points to consider when deciding:</p>

        <p>First, research using the shared coded study data can be on any topic, not just psoriasis. The research might be on topics you disagree with or find offensive.</p>

        <p>Second, you cannot take back your data once it is used in another research study.</p>

        <p>Third, future research may lead to patentable discoveries or commercial product(s). You will not profit from these future research. For example, you will not be paid for being in the study and/or sharing your data.</p>
        
        <p>Think carefully about sharing your coded study data for other research. Make the choice that feels right for you.</p>
