        <p>If you join the study we will ask you questions about your health and your medical history.  We will ask if you have psoriasis and the type of psoriasis treatments you have.  Because the purpose of this study is to look for patterns over time, we will ask you to review and update your answers from time to time.</p>
        <p>We will ask you to do interactive activities with your phone.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk with your phone in your pocket. This is to measure your gait.</li>
            <li>Take photos of your skin if you have psoriasis, and a photo of your fingers and toes to look for nail psoriasis or dactylitis.</li>
            <li>Turn your arms while your phone is on a table to measure your range of motion</li>
            <li>Sensors are also found in fitness trackers like the Apple Watch that measure your physical activity. These data are stored on Apple HealthKit. With your permission, we can add these other data to the study. This is an optional part of the study. You can participate in this study even if you do not want to share your data from HealthKit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These activities need your phoneâ€™s touch screen and sensors on. You can enable notifications from the app to receive reminders to do these surveys and activities.</p>
