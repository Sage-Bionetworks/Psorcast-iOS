        <p>Your privacy is very important to us. Here are a few of the steps we will take to protect your privacy:</p>

        <p>The data will be encrypted on the phone.  This means that it is transformed into a random and meaningless message that people cannot easily understand.  We need a special key or password to read the encrypted data.</p>

        <p>We will separate your account information (like your name, date of birth or email) from your study data (the responses to surveys, results from activities and sensor measurements).</p>

        <p>We will use a code instead of your name to label your study data. The code is random. It is not based on any of information that identifies you.</p>

        <p>We will limit and track who sees your information. Only key personnel from the study team will be able connect your coded study data to your named account information.</p>

        <p>In order to work with your coded study data, scientists must agree not to try to find out who you are. Results of this study will be published. Only the coded study data will be used. Your identity will not be shared.</p>

        <p>We will tell you if there is a data breach. If required by law, we may give your contact information and identifiable study data. Please consult our Privacy Policy for more details.</p>
